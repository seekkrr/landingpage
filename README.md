## üñºÔ∏è Background Image Optimization

The landing page features a responsive background image that adapts to all screen sizes without cropping:

### Background Image Features

-   **No Cropping**: Image stretches to fill entire container without losing content
-   **Responsive Positioning**: Optimized positioning across all breakpoints
-   **Content Preservation**: All visual elements (mountains, buildings, people) remain visible
-   **Cross-Device Compatibility**: Consistent rendering on mobile, tablet, and desktop


### Background Aspect Ratio Policy (PR 1)

Background images now maintain a ~10% stretch threshold to preserve aspect ratio. When more distortion would be required, the image is centered using contain and remaining space is white.

To adjust behavior, see `src/styles/background.css` or `src/components/BackgroundWrapper.jsx`.
